# Current-Weather-Condition-App
Project Overview  The Weather App is a Python-based GUI application built using CustomTkinter, which provides a modern and responsive UI. This app allows users to fetch real-time weather data by entering a city name. It retrieves weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions using the Open-Meteo API.
