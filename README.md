# Current-Weather-Condition-App
Project Overview  The Weather App is a Python-based GUI application built using CustomTkinter, which provides a modern and responsive UI. This app allows users to fetch real-time weather data by entering a city name. It retrieves weather information such as temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions using the Open-Meteo API. 
#Key Features#

    Modern UI with CustomTkinter – Uses a sleek and customizable interface for an enhanced user experience.

    Real-time Weather Data – Fetches the latest weather conditions, including:

        🌡️ Temperature (°C)

        🍃 Wind Speed (km/h)

        🔢 Weather Condition Code

    City Name to Coordinates Conversion – Uses the Geopy library to fetch latitude and longitude.

    Error Handling – Displays appropriate error messages for invalid city names or API failures.

    Compact & Lightweight – Runs smoothly without heavy dependencies.
